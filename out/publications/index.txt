16:T4ca,Collaborative spatial crowdsourcing leverages distributed workers' collective intelligence to accomplish spatial tasks. A central challenge is to efficiently assign suitable workers to collaborate on these tasks. Although mainstream reinforcement learning (RL) methods have proven effective in task allocation, they face two key obstacles: delayed reward feedback and non-stationary data distributions, both hindering optimal allocation and collaborative efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose CAFE (credit assignment and fine-tuning enhanced), a novel multi-agent RL framework for spatial crowdsourcing. CAFE introduces a credit assignment mechanism that distributes rewards based on workers' contributions and spatiotemporal constraints, coupled with bi-level meta-optimization to jointly optimize credit assignment and RL policy. To handle non-stationary spatial task distributions, CAFE employs an adaptive fine-tuning procedure that efficiently adjusts credit assignment parameters while preserving collaborative knowledge. Experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior performance in terms of task completion and equitable reward redistribution.17:T49c,Dependency-aware spatial crowdsourcing (DASC) addresses the unique challenges posed by subtask dependencies in spatial task assignment. This paper investigates the task assignment problem in DASC and proposes a two-stage Recommend and Match Optimization (RMO) framework, leveraging multi-agent reinforcement learning for subtask recommendation and a multi-dimensional utility function for subtask matching. The RMO framework primarily addresses two key challenges: credit assignment for subtasks with interdependencies and maintaining overall coherence between subtask recommendation and matching. Specifically, we employ meta-gradients to construct auxiliary policies and establish a gradient connection between two stages, which can effectively address credit assignment and joint optimization of subtask recommendation and matching, while concurrently accelerating network training. We further establish a unified gradient descent process through gradient synchronization across recommendation networks, auxiliary policies, and the matching utility evaluation function. Experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed approach.18:T563,With the proliferation of mobile devices, spatial crowdsourcing has emerged as a promising paradigm for facilitating location-based services, encompassing various applications across academia and industries. Recently, pioneering works have attempted to infer workers' mobility patterns from historical data to improve the quality of task assignment. However, these studies have overlooked or under-examined issues such as the dynamic mobility patterns of crowd workers, especially in the context of newcomers, the misalignment between the objectives of mobility prediction and task assignment, and the effective utilization of predicted mobility patterns. In this paper, we investigate a problem we term Task Assignment in Mobility Prediction-aware Spatial Crowdsourcing (TAMP). To address the TAMP problem, we first propose a task-adaptive meta-learning algorithm, which trains a set of specific meta-knowledge for workers' mobility prediction models through game theory-based learning task clustering and meta-training within each cluster. Then, we design a task assignment-oriented loss function and develop a task assignment algorithm that incorporates prediction performance, prioritizing assignments with higher confidence of completion. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that our proposed methods can effectively improve the quality of task assignment.19:T492,Top-k Publish/Subscribe (TkPS) service is widely studied in spatial database, with various cache-based methods proposed to address its efficiency challenge in top-k result maintenance. These methods require in-depth exploration of relationships between cache updates and different factors (e.g., data distribution) to optimize cache performance. However, there is currently no system available that assists developers in conducting comprehensive cache analyses within TkPS services. We therefore introduce Catcher, a multi-functional cache analysis system designed for TkPS services. It not only enables users to intuitively analyze the entire maintenance process of top-k results but also aids in identifying bottlenecks and potential optimization spaces of caches. Catcher provides two user-friendly interfaces that allow users to employ simple and easy-to-use consoles to perform statistical analysis. Furthermore, Catcher offers the real-time evaluation of cache-based methods, providing users with instant analysis. We have demonstrated the usability of Catcher on real-world datasets.
