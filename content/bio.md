I will join Nanjing University as an incoming PhD student in Fall 2026, advised by [Prof. Guanghui Zhu](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zgh/).
Prior to this, I obtained an M.Sc. in Software Engineering (under the supervision of [Prof. Yafei Li](https://zzudb.github.io) and a B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from Zhengzhou University.

My current research focuses on the training and fine-tuning of large language models, with an emphasis on preference alignment and reinforcement learning from human feedback.
